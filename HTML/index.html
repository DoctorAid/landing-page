                Welcome onboard to <b>"DoctorAid" </b>a platform revolutionizing healthcare accessibility 
                and organization for families and healthcare professionals in Sri Lanka.
                In today’s fast-paced world, finding timely and efficient healthcare remains a challenge. 
                Families often struggle to locate nearby doctors, schedule appointments efficiently, 
                and manage medical records. Meanwhile, doctors rely on outdated methods like manual 
                appointment systems and physical record-keeping, resulting in inefficiencies and poor communication.
                DoctorAid bridges this gap by offering an all-in-one, user-friendly healthcare solution that connects 
                families with trusted medical professionals, streamlines appointment management, and ensures seamless, 
                secure handling of medical records. With DoctorAid, healthcare becomes simpler, faster, and more organized 
                for everyone.
